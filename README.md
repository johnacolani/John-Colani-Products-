# John Colani — Product Design Portfolio

> *"I design products that respect users — their emotions, time, privacy, and context. Whether the system is AI-assisted, personalized, or real-time, my goal is always the same: create meaningful, scalable, and human-centered experiences."*

---

## Overview

This repository showcases **two distinct product design projects** that reflect my end-to-end approach: from problem discovery and user research to design systems, prototyping, and cross-platform delivery. Both products demonstrate **human-centered design** applied to different domains — enterprise B2B and consumer spiritual wellness.

---

## Design Philosophy

Design, for me, does not begin with screens or tools. **It begins with understanding people.**

My background in industrial design shapes how I think about products holistically. In physical products, I consider material, safety, emotional comfort, and context of use. I carry the same responsibility into digital product design: visual clutter is a *cognitive sharp edge*, poor hierarchy creates *fatigue and confusion*, and ignoring privacy can *emotionally harm users*.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Empathy as Foundation** | No long surveys — conversations, observation, listening. Users share real needs only when respected. |
| **Problem-First Thinking** | Uncover multiple hidden issues (functional, emotional, environmental) before proposing solutions. |
| **Context-Aware Design** | Adapt to time of day, season, environment — whether physical or digital. |
| **Progressive Personalization** | Consent-based personalization at scale; users choose standard or personalized experience. |
| **AI with Human Oversight** | Transparency, control, trust, privacy — AI assists but cannot replace empathy or judgment. |

## Product Design Showcase

### 1. Absolute Stone Design (ASD) — Enterprise Platform

**Role:** Product Designer (UX/UI, Design System, Cross-Platform, AI Governance)  
**Stack:** Flutter, Figma, Firebase, Design Tokens  
**Platforms:** iOS • Android • Web

#### The Challenge

Fragmented workflows across clients, sales reps, installers, schedulers, and administrators caused inefficiency, miscommunication, and poor user experience in a stone fabrication business.

#### Design Approach

- Defined 5 user roles and mapped workflows for each
- Used empathy and observation to uncover hidden problems
- Built role-based dashboards, adaptive interfaces, and a controlled AI assistant ("Amy")
- Created a shared design system for consistency across mobile and web
- Applied CIRCLES method, STAR framework, and WCAG Level AA accessibility

#### Highlights

| Area | What I Delivered |
|------|------------------|
| **User Experience** | Unified platform replacing fragmented tools; role-specific dashboards; web-first UX (skip onboarding, auth-on-demand) |
| **AI Assistant** | GPT-powered "Amy" with knowledge base, conversation logging, human oversight |
| **Design System** | Cross-platform tokens (color, typography, spacing), component library, WCAG AA compliance |
| **Accessibility** | 4.5:1+ contrast, 44×44px touch targets, screen reader support, keyboard navigation |

### 2. Twin Scriptures — Consumer Spiritual App

**Role:** Product Designer & Developer  
**Stack:** Flutter  
**Platforms:** iOS • Android • Web • Linux • macOS • Windows

#### The Challenge

Design a scripture reading experience that feels personal, emotionally resonant, and respectful of diverse cultural contexts (Persian, Turkish, English).

#### Design Approach

**"Show me what you like, don't tell me in a form."**

Instead of surveys and forms, I designed **visual preference selection**: users choose seasons, emotions, fonts, and themes by *seeing* options, not filling fields. This creates a faster, more engaging onboarding and a stronger emotional connection.

#### Highlights

| Area | What I Delivered |
|------|------------------|
| **Visual Personalization** | Season selection (spring, summer, fall, winter), special occasions (Christmas, New Year, Nowruz), emotional themes, font choices |
| **Progressive Onboarding** | Image-based selection grids; minimal friction; exploration instead of interrogation |
| **Context-Aware UX** | Dynamic themes based on time of day, season, and user preference; dark mode support |
| ** inclusivity** | Multi-language (Persian, Turkish, English); RTL support; accessible typography |

#### Design Principles Applied

1. **Visual First** — Every preference presented visually
2. **Minimal Friction** — No lengthy forms; select and continue
3. **Emotional Connection** — Moods, seasons, feelings users relate to instantly
4. **Respectful of Time** — Quick selections that feel like exploration
